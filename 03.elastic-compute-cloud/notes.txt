Amazon EC2
- is the most popular service in aws 
- EC2 -> Elastic Compute Cloud 
- it is infrastructure as a service 
- You can :
    rent virtual machines on ec2 (EC2)
    store data on virtual drives (EBS)
    distribute load across machines (ELB)
    scale services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
-knowing how to use ec2 is fundamental in knowing how cloud works 


What can we choose for our instances/virtual servers 
1. Operating Systems -> Linux, Windows, Mac OS 
2. Compute power & cores (CPU) you want for your vms 
3. How much Random Access Memory (RAM)
4. How much storage space / Hard disk 
5. Network card type, speed of the card, Public IP address
6. Firewall rules; security groups 
7. Bootstrap script (configure at first launch) : EC2 user data 

- it is possible to Bootstrap our instances using an EC2 user data script 
- bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts 
- that script is only ran once at the instance first start and will never run again. 
- EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
    install updates 
    install software 
    download common files from internet 
    anything you can think of 
    NB: the more you add the more the instance boot time increases 
- The EC2 user data script runs with the root user i.e sudo 


EC2 Instance Types 
- t2.micro
- t2.xlarge 
- c5d.4xlarge 
- r5.16xlarge 
- m5.8xlarge 
NB: these are just a few examples

Hands-On 
- launching an ec2 instance running linux 
- use aws console 
- get high level to various params 
- launch a web server using ec2 user data 
- start, stop, terminate instances 

Steps:
- search for ec2 
- choose region (make it the one near you)
- click instances 
- launch instances 
- choose ami (Amazon Machine Image)
- an AMI contains the operating system, application server, and applications for your instance.

Instance Types Overview 
- different instances types are optimized for different use cases 
- There are seven different types 
1. General purpose 
2. Compute Optimized 
3. Memory Optimized 
4. Accelerated Computing 
5. Storage Optimized 
6. Instance Features 
7. Measuring Instance Performance 

NB: Each instance types has different family types eg m5.2xlarge
m -> instance class 
5 -> generation (aws improve them over time)
2xlarge -> the size within the instance class 

NB: Compare the instances at ec2instances.info website
