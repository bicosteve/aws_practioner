** Elastic Load Balancing & Auto Scaling Group ** 

1. Scalability & High Availability 
- scalability means that an application/system can handle greater loads by adapting. 
- two kinds of scalability:
* vertical scalabilityc 
    -  increase the size of the instance 
    - eg application runs on t2.micro,you can vertically scale it to run on t2.large
    - vertical scalability is common for non distributed systems like database
    - this is done for performance 
    - there is a limit on how much you can scale the hardware.

* horizontal scalability (elastic)
    - instead of increase the size, you increase the **number** of instances 
    - distributed systems are horizontally scaled
    - common for modern web applications/modern applications 
    
* high availability
- this means you are running your application/systems in atleast two availability zones.
- goal is to survive a disaster
- 

Terms 
scalability -> ability of a system to accomodate a larger load by making the hardware stronger (scale up), or by adding nodes (scale out). 
elasticity -> system can be scaled based on the load. it is cloud friendly pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs.
agility -> this means how fast you can make resources available from weeks to just minutes. 

2. Elastic Load Balancing 
- Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 instances) downstream 
- This is managed by aws 
- we can have one load balancer which is the entry point where users access our systems. 
- behind the load balancer, we can have more than one instance where the load balancer distribute internet traffic to each of the servers 
- the more users you have the more the load it distributes to the instances 
- ELB is a managed load balancer meaning aws will manage it for you 
- you only need to configure the knobs 
- you can create your own load balancer in aws but it will be more costly in terms of effort for your in terms of maintainance, integration etc 
- 

Why Load Balancer 
- it spreads load across multiple instances downstream 
- expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application 
- seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances 
- do regular health check to your instances 
- provide SSL termination (HTTPs) for your website 
- high availability across zones

Types of load balancers 
    1. Application Load Balancer 
        - this is layer 7 load balancer 
        - is for (HTTP/HTTPS) only 
    2. Network Load Balancer 
        - ultra-high performance 
        - allows for tcp
        - layer 4
    3. Classic Load Balancer 
        - provides layer 4 & 7 
        - slowly being retired
