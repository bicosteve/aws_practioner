What do servers have
1. CPU for compute 
2. RAM (Memory) for temporary storage 
3. Data (Storage) used to permanently store data 
4. Database for structured data 
5. Network : Routers, switch, DNS server 


Cloud Computing 
- on-demand deliver of compute power, database storage, applications, and IT resources.
- it is pay as you go 
- provision exactly the right type and size of compute resources 
- resources are provisioned instantly 
- simple way to access servers, storage, database and apps 

Types of clouds 
- private cloud  eg rockspace 
- public cloud eg aws, azure, gcp 
- hybrid cloud mix of private and public 


Xtics of cloud computing 
- fully on demand and self service 
- broad network with resources 
- multi-tenancy and resource pooling i.e customer can share infra and application.
- rapid elasticity and scalability 
- usage is measured as you pay for exactly what you have used. 

Type of cloud computing 

1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- provides building block for cloud IT 
- provides networking, computers, data storage space 
- highest level of flexibility 
- easy to parrallel with traditional on-prem IT 
- eg ec2 

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- removes the need for organization to manage underlying infrastructure 
- you only focus on deployment of your application 
- eg Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, App Engine 

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
- everything is managed by provider 
- eg jira, gmail etc 


AWS Concepts 
1. Regions -> are available all over the world with the the african one being in South Africa. 
- regions have names like us-east-1, eu-west-3
- a region is a cluster of data centers 
- services are scoped to a region 
How to choose a region ?
- factors 
- compliance eg data governance 
- latency. When your users are in us, pick us regions 
- avaialability of services confirm if a feature or service is in your region 
- pricing varies from region to region therefore pick the one which suits you.

2. Zones -> these are what are going into the regions 
-  they are usually 3 with min of 2 and max of 6 
- these are discret data center which have redundant power, networking, and connectivity 
- they are isolated from each other therefore protects against disaster 
- connected with high bandwith ultra low latency network 


3. Point of presence/Edge Locations 
- aws has 216 points of presenc in 84 cities across 42 countries.
