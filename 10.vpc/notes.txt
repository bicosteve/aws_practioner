01. VPC & Subnets Primer 
- VPC -> virtual private cloud 
- VPC is a regional resource 
- inside the vpc you have subnets 
- subnets allow you to partition your network inside your vpc 
- subnets are in AZ 
- you can have public and private subnets 
- public subnet is accessible through the internet and private subnet is only accessible within the vpc 
- to define access to the internet and between subnets you will use *Route Tables* 
- AWS gives you a default VPC with public subnet and not private subnet 

02. Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways 
- Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances to connect with the Internet 
- Internet gateway lives in the VPC 
- Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway 
- NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instance (self-managed) allows your instaces in the private subnet to access the internet while remaining private 
- NAT instances is deployed in the public subnet then provide a route for the instances on the private subnet to access NAT which has access to the Internet Gateway then to the Internet 


03. Network ACL & Security Groups 
* Network Access Control List (NACL) *  
- A Network ACL is a set of rules that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level in a network. 
- It acts like a firewall for subnets, deciding whether to allow or deny packets based on IP addresses.
- controls traffic to and from the subnet 
- has ALLOW or DENY rules 
- are attached at the subnet level 
- rules ONLY include IP addresses 
- any traffic first reach NACL before getting to the instances on the subnet 

* Security Groups * 
- a firewall that controls traffic to and from Elastic Network Interface (ENI) or EC2 instance 
- it can ONLY have ALLOW rules 
- they can reference IP addresses or other security group 


04. VPC Flow Logs 
- campture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces 
- the traffic can be vpc flow logs, subnet flow logs, elastic network interface flow logs etc 
- it is used to monitor and trouble shoot connectivity issues eg subnet to internet, internet to subnets 
- captures network informaition from anything managed by AWS 


05. VPC Peering 
- connect two vpc privately using AWS network 
- makes vpc behave as if they wer on the same network 
- to be able to make VPC peering, make sure the CIDR (IP address ranges) are not overlapping. 
- VPC peering must be established for each vpc that needs to communicate with one another. here if you have VPC A, B, C. If you connect A -> B and A -> C, B and C cannot talk to each other. B and C can only communicate through their own peering 


06. VPC Endpoints 
- endpoints allow you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of the public www network. 
- by default, all aws services are public ! 
- vpc endpoints gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services 
- it is only used within your vpc 

07. Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect 
* Site to Site VPN * 
- connects an on-premises VPN to AWS 
- the connection is automatically encrypted 
- it goes over the Internet 

* Direct Connect (DX) * 
- establishes a physical connection between on-premises and AWS 
- the connection is private, secure and fast 
- goes over a private network 
- takes atlease a month to establish 


08. LAMP Stack on EC2 
- linux : OS for ec2 instances 
- apache : web server that run on linux (ec2)
- mysql : database on RDS 
- PHP : application logic (running on EC2)
- can add redis/memcached (elasticach) to include caching 
- store local application data & software to Elastic Block Storage drive in the root

1. 3 tier architecture 
2. wordpress on AWS
