1. S3 Object Encryption 
- you can encrypt objects in S3 buckets using one of the 4 methods 
- Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
 * SSE with amazon s3-managed keys. 
    Enabled by default. 
    It is managed and owned by AWS. 
    Security type is AES-256. Must set header to 'x-amz-server-side-encryption':'AES256'. 
    Enabled by default for new objects and new buckets.

 * SSE with KMS keys stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). 
    Leverage AWS keys management service to manage encryption keys. 
    User have control and can audit key using cloudtrail 
    Object is encrypted server side 
    Must set header 'x-amz-server-side-encryption':'aws:kms'
    Has limitation since you must make call to kms service when you upload and download your objects. These calls count towards the KMS quota per second.


 * SSE with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). 
    Keys are managed by the customer outside of AWS 
    Amazon does not store the encryption key you provide 
    HTTPS must be used and encryption key must be provided in HTTP headers for every HTTP request made. 



- Client-Side Encryption 
    Use client libraries such S# client-side encryption library 
    Client must encrypt data themselves before sending to Amazon S3 
    Client must decrypt data themselves when retrieving it from S3 
    Client fully manages the key and encryption cycle 

- Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
    Encryption in flight also called SSL/TLS 
    S3 exposes two endpoints:
     - HTTP endpoint non encrypted 
     - HTTPS endpoint for encryption in flight 
    HTTPS is recommended 
    HTTPS is mandatory for SSE-C 
    You can enfornce encryption in transit if aws:SecureTransport:false 

2. S3 CORS 
- cors -> cross-origin resource sharing 
- Orign -> scheme (protocol) + host(domain) + port 
- it is web browser based mechanism to allow request to toher origins while visiting main origin 
- if a client makes a cross-origin requet on s3 bucket, we need to enable the correct CORS headers 
- you can allow for specific origin or for * (all origins)


3. MFA Delete 
- force users to generate a code on a device (eg mobile phone or hardware) before doing important operations on S3 
- Required when :
    permanently delete an object version 
    suspend versioning on the bucket 
- Not required when to: 
    enable versioning 
    list deleted versions 
- To use MFA delete, versioning must be enabled on the bucket 
- Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA delete 

4. S3 Access Logs 
- for audit purposes, you may want to log all access to s3 buckets 
- any request made to S3 from any account, authorized or denied,  is going to be logged into another S3 bucket 
- you can then use data analytics tool like amazon athena to analyze the data 
- target logging bucket must also be in the same AWS region 
- never set set your logging bucket to be the bucket you are logging at is you do, you will have a logging loop and it is very expensive.

5. S3 Pre-signed URLs
- these are urls you can generate using the S3 console, AWS CLI or SDK 
- the url has expiration eg 12hrs or 168hrs 
- users are given permisssions of the user who generated the url to perform GET/PUT operations and can access to a file 
- common use case for temporary access 
- examples :
    * allow only logged in users to download a premium video from your s3 bucket
    * allow an ever changing list of user to download files by generating URLs dynamically 
    * allow user to temporarily upload a file to a precise location in your S3 bucket 

6. S3 Access Points 
- you can define policies which grants access to individual user groups for various objects in s3 bucket eg finance, sales, etc 
- this results in simple ways to manage access and scale the access 
- simplifies security management to s3 
- each access point has dns and manages security at scale 
-  we can define access points to be privately accessible only within the VPC 

7. S3 Object Lambda
- use lambda functions to change the object before it is retrieved by the caller application 
- only one s3 bucket is needed on top of which we create S3 access point and S3 object lambda access points
