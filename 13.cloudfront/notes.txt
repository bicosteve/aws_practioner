2. CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication 
- cloudfront has global edge network location 
- cloudfront has files cached for a TTL (maybe a day)
- cloudfront is great for static content that must be available everywhere 
- S3 cross region replication must be set up for each region you want replication to happen 
- files are updated in real-time 
- it is read only 
- great for dynamic content that needs to be available for low latency in few regions
