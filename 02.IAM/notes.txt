IAM: Users & Groups 

IAM - Identity and Access Management, Global Service 
- Creates users and assign them to groups 
- root user is part of IAM 
- should not use root user or share the details 
- users are people within an organization and can be grouped 
- groups can only contain users not other groups 
- some users may not belong to a group 
- a user can belong to multiple groups 
- groups & users are created to allow them use aws resources 
- users and groups can be assigned a json document called policies 

sample policies
{
    "version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement":[
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":"ec2:Describe*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":"elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
            "Resource":"*"
        },
        {
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Action":[
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                "cloudwatch:Describe*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

- these policies define permissions of users 
- apply least principle privilege.

IAM Policies inheritance
- imagine you have a group of developers bix, mike, dan 
- we attach a policy at group level, all the three will get the developers policies
- we can also have another group Operation for david, edward 
- we can also have inline policy for  Fred who does not belong to any group 
- we can also have AuditTeam which David and Dan can belong to 
- in this case, David and Dan will be in two groups 

IAM Policies Structure 
- consists of:
    1. Version:policy language version, always include "1012-10-17".
    2. Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
    3. Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
- Statement consists of 
    - Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
    - Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow,Deny)
    - Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
    - Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies 
    - Resource: list of resources to which the actions will be applied to 
    - Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional)

sample 

{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Id":"S3-Account-Permissions",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid":"1",
            "Effect":"Allow",
            "Principal":{
                "AWS":["arn:aws:iam::123456789:root"]
            }
        },
        "Action":[
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject"
        ],
        "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3::::mybucket/*"]
    ]
}

NB
- you can use aws predefined policies by click on policies in IAM service 
- you can also create your own policy 
- navigate to policies -> create policy : you can use visual editor or json 
- for visual editor just pick a Service eg IAM 
- choose an Action eg ListUser
- choose a Resource(s) eg Specific or All Resources 
- you can also pick request condition 


IAM - Password Policy 
a) Strong passwords = higher security for your account 
- in aws you can set up a password policy with:
    - min password lenght
    - require specific characters types eg uppercase, lowercase, numbers, non-alphanumeric characters 
    - allow all IAM users to change their own passwords 
    - require users to change password after sometime 
    - prevent password reuse 
- this prevents brute force 

b) Multi Factor Authentication - MFA 
- it is a must in aws 
- you want to protect your root accounts and IAM users 
- MFA combines your password and a security device of your own.
- password and mfa generate token => success login 
- MFA options 
    Passkey or security key 
    Authenticator app 
    Hardware TOTP token 
- mfa devices options 
    virtual mfa device eg google authenticator, authy 
    universal 2nd factor (u2f) security key 
    hardware key fob mfa device 


Accessing AWS Console 
- To access AWS, you have three options:
    AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
    AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): protected by access keys 
    AWS Software Development Kit (SDK) proteced by access keys 
- access keys are generated through the AWS console 
- users manage their own access keys 
- access keys are secrets like passwords 


AWS CLI & SDK
- A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in the command-line shell. 
- every command starts with `aws` 
- with this command you get access to the public APIs of AWS services 
- cli is open source and alternative to console 
- SDK is langaugae specific and enable you to access and manage AWS services programmatically.
- it is embedded within application 


Creating Security Credentials 
- NB: do not use your root user to create security credentials 
- User -> username -> Security credentials -> Access keys 
- You will get the access key and secret access key
- use aws configure 
- set AWS access key id 
- set AWS secret access key 
- set default region 
- you can leave default output format empty 
- use `aws iam list-users` to view all the users in your account 
- returns something like this 
{
    "Users": [
        {
            "Path": "/",
            "UserName": "user",
            "UserId": "****",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::****:user/user",
            "CreateDate": "2025-08-26T01:49:07+00:00",
            "PasswordLastUsed": "2025-08-27T01:32:39+00:00"
        }
    ]
}

- Management console and cli are similar. 

Cloud Shell 
- is an alternative to console and cli 
- cloud shell is located on the top right with `>_` icon 
- click on it then start issuing aws commands 
- it is a terminal in the cloud of aws 
- it returns api call as if the api calls being used 
- you can specify the region you want to use 


IAM Roles for services 
- some aws servie will need to perform actions on our behalf 
- to do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM roles 
- common roles include:
     ec2 instance roles 
     lambda function roles 
     cloudformation roles 
- use the `Roles` on IAM menu 

IAM Security Tools 
- we can create IAM credentials report at account-level 
- this report will list all your account users and status of their credentials 


IAM Access Advisor 
- this is at the user-level and shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
- important on the principle of the least privilege

Steps 
- click `Credential report` on the IAM and then download the report 


IAM Guidelines & Best Practise 
- do not use the root account except for AWS account setup 
- one physical user = one AWS user 
- assing users to groups and assign permission at group level 
- create strong password policy 
- use and enforce the use of Mutli Factor Authentication (MFA)
- create and use roles for giving permissions to AWS services 
- generate access keys to access aws cli/sdk 
- to auditn permissions of your account use IAM Credentials Report 
- Never share IAM users and access key
