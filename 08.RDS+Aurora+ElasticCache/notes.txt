Amazon RDS Overview 
- RDS stand for Relational Database Service 
- It is managed db service for DB use of SQL as a query language 
- Allows you to create databases managed by AWS 
- Types of db are mysql, postgres, mariadb, orcacle, microsoft 

Advantage 
- RDS is managed service 
- provisioning is automated 
- continous backups are provided 
- has monitoring dashboard
- multi AZ 
- maintainance winndow update 
- scaling capability(vertical and horizontal)

RDS Read Replicas
- read replicas are used for read scalability
- upto 15 read replicas 
- provided within AZ, across AZ or Cross Region 
- replication is ASYNC so reads are eventually consistent 
- replicas can be promoted to their own db 
- applications ust update the connection string to leverage read replicas 


Use Case of Read Replicas 
- you have a production database that is taking on normal load 
- you want to run a reporting  application to run some analytics 
- create a read replica to avoid overloading the production database 
- read replicas only use SELECT *
NB: 
There is a newtork cost when data goes from one AZ to another 
For RDS read replicas within the same region you will not pay fee 
For read replicas withi data moving from one region to the next region, you will pay!

RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)
- SYNC replication from master to the standby database 
- they have one DNS name for automatic app faiover to standby db 
- increases availability 
- fail over incase of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance or storage failure 

RDS - From single AZ to Multi-AZ 
- this is zero downtim process 
- you do not need to stop the database 
- you need to just click on 'Modify' for the database 
- sync replication will start
